* Changes in BITMAP-MULE 8.1


** Multi-size fonts are now supported (except for Mule 1.*)
Besides 8x16, contains 6x12, 7x14 and 12x24 fonts generated by bdfresize.
Note that Emacs is not always a good image viewer if you use the fonts
except for 8x16. :-<


* Changes in BITMAP-MULE 8.0


** Mule 1.1 PL04 based on Emacs 18.59 is now supported


** Requires APEL 9.22 or later


** X-Face-Mule (x-face-mule.el) has been replaced with KORIYAMA-san's version
It is based on X-Face-Mule v0.27 and modified for the use of APEL, to
separate Gnus/gnus or VM related functions into the optional modules.


** BITMAP-DECOR's splash function for Gnus/gnus is included in gnus-bitmap.el
