* Changes in BITMAP-MULE 8.4
============================

** The obsolete function `x-face-mule-x-face-decode-message-header' has
been abolished.  Use `x-face-decode-message-header' without argument from
now on.

** Function `bitmap-compose' now has an optional arg `rotation'.
It can make a different string even if which has the same representation.

** Rename `lprogress-display' to `progress-feedback-with-label'.
It has been done in XEmacs 21.2.36.  The old function is now obsolete.

** Use of compface package v1.3 or later is recommended.
These versions of `uncompface' can generate XBM format directly.  It makes
X-Face-Mule display X-Face a little bit faster.

** BDF files (except for 8x16) are separated from BITMAP-MULE distribution.
They can be generated by executing `make' in font/ directory or the
ready-made files are available from anon-ftp.  See font/README.{en,ja}
for more information.

** You can now use 10x20 font if you like.


* Changes in BITMAP-MULE 8.3
============================

** New function `lprogress-display'.
Emulates the function which comes from XEmacs 21.2.32.

** BBDB(Big Brother Database) is supported.
Display the `X-Face' images, In *BBDB* mode.


* Changes in BITMAP-MULE 8.2
============================

** Bug fixes related with `gnus-bitmap'
Don't redefine the function `gnus-group-startup-message' if the function
`gnus-bitmap-splash' is not added to `gnus-load-hook'.

** Use `-X' option of uncompafce program
It becomes a little faster if you use compface-1.2.  However, compface-1.2
has a bug.  Please apply the patch named "compface-1.2.patch", which is
included in this distribution, before installing it.

except for 8x16. :-<
