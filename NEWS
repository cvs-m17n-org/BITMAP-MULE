* Changes in BITMAP-MULE 8.5
============================

** A patch for the released version of Emacs 21.1 is now available.
It is included in the BITMAP-MULE distribution, named:

   emacs-21.1-composite.patch

It makes Emacs 21.1 can load bitmap images from a file or save bitmap
images to a file with automatic code conversion correctly.

** The preferred coding-system for the charset `bitmap' is now set to
`iso-2022-7bit'.

** New variable `bitmap-use-alterable-charset-anyway' now controls
whether to substitute `indian-1-column' or `tibetan-1-column' for the
new private charset `bitmap' unconditionally.  You can load "bitmap"
before "un-define" by setting this to non-nil.  Don't forget to set
the value of the variable `bitmap-alterable-charset'.  For example:

   (setq bitmap-alterable-charset 'indian-1-column)
   (setq bitmap-use-alterable-charset-anyway t)
   (require 'bitmap)
   (require 'un-define)


* Changes in BITMAP-MULE 8.4
============================

** IMPORTANT notice to Mule-UCS on Emacs 20 users !!
If you are using Emacs 20 and Mule-UCS version 0.84 or later, you have
to set the value of the variable `bitmap-alterable-charset' explicitly,
and furthermore, you have to load un-define.elc before bitmap.elc.
The valid values for the variable `bitmap-alterable-charset' are
`indian-1-column' and `tibetan-1-column'.  Here is an example for the
startup (normally .emacs) file:

   (require 'un-define)
   (setq bitmap-alterable-charset 'tibetan-1-column)
   (require 'bitmap)

We must apologize that the charset used in `bitmap-alterable-charset'
becomes totally unserviceable to the inconvenience of Indian or Tibetan.

** Font files are no longer distributed with BITMAP-MULE.
Instead, they will be generated by make, named bitmap16.bdf, etc.  See
font/README.{en,ja} for more information.  Note that the generated font
files will have "Misc" foundry in XLFD form which was formerly "ETL".

** BITMAP-MULE now supports Emacs 21.
But using BITMAP-MULE is not the best choice if your Emacs can display
images inline.  It should be replaced with the modern programs.

** The obsolete function `x-face-mule-x-face-decode-message-header' has
been abolished.  Use `x-face-decode-message-header' without argument from
now on.

** Function `bitmap-compose' now has an optional arg `rotation'.
It can make a different string even if which has the same representation.

** Rename `lprogress-display' to `progress-feedback-with-label'.
It has been done in XEmacs 21.2.36.  The old function is now obsolete.
You can turn off showing the bargraph by setting the option
`bitmap-progress-feedback-textual' to non-nil.

** Use of compface package v1.3 or later is recommended.
These versions of `uncompface' can generate XBM format directly.  It makes
X-Face-Mule display X-Face a little bit faster.

** You can now use 10x20 font if you like.


* Changes in BITMAP-MULE 8.3
============================

** New function `lprogress-display'.
Emulates the function which comes from XEmacs 21.2.32.

** BBDB(Big Brother Database) is supported.
Display the `X-Face' images, In *BBDB* mode.


* Changes in BITMAP-MULE 8.2
============================

** Bug fixes related with `gnus-bitmap'
Don't redefine the function `gnus-group-startup-message' if the function
`gnus-bitmap-splash' is not added to `gnus-load-hook'.

** Use `-X' option of uncompafce program
It becomes a little faster if you use compface-1.2.  However, compface-1.2
has a bug.  Please apply the patch named "compface-1.2.patch", which is
included in this distribution, before installing it.


* Changes in BITMAP-MULE 8.1
============================

** Multi-size fonts are now supported (except for Mule 1.*)
Besides 8x16, contains 6x12, 7x14 and 12x24 fonts generated by bdfresize.
Note that Emacs is not always a good image viewer if you use the fonts
except for 8x16. :-<


* Changes in BITMAP-MULE 8.0
============================

** Mule 1.1 PL04 based on Emacs 18.59 is now supported


** Requires APEL 9.22 or later


** X-Face-Mule (x-face-mule.el) has been replaced with KORIYAMA-san's version
It is based on X-Face-Mule v0.27 and modified for the use of APEL, to
separate Gnus/gnus or VM related functions into the optional modules.


** BITMAP-DECOR's splash function for Gnus/gnus is included in gnus-bitmap.el
